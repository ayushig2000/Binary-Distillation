# Binary-Distillation
We studied distillation column and its related process. Our task was to use McCabe Thiele process and write a code using MATLAB which does the following-
Input of the code -
    1. Distillate and bottom composition of light key component
    2. Relative volatility
Output of the code
    1. Minimum no of stages required to achieve the separation(with graph)
    2. Minimum Reflux Ratio
    3. Actual no  of stages required to achieve separation(with graph)
Our next task was to design the distillation column using designing software Aspen hysys.
